Hi, I'm DongGun Lee, a researcher working at LG Innotek. 
I am interested in developing new computational methodologies to solve complex problems in physics 
based on deep mathematical understanding. The problems I am interested in usually involve 
high-performance computing technologies such as parallel computing and GPU acceleration.
<!-- Currently, I'm looking for a postdoctoral position in USA. -->
